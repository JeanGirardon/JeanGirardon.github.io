    deposition and coating (chemical deposits, electrolytic deposits,
    chemical conversions)

* **April - July 2017 : Bachelor project**
  * Campus Biotech, Geneva
  * Project title : Optimization of a pad printing machine for fast prototyping
  * Resume : Tampography is an indirect stamp printing process used to print small
    electronic circuits. The project consisted of developing a system for
    rectifying a possible offset (determined by image processing) between
    two layers of a printed circuit.
